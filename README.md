# INTRODUCTION
Welcome to our corner of the internet! This project wasn't just about writing code; it was about taking my raw resume and transforming it into a live, accessible web identity.
The goal was simple: Build a personal resume site using HTML/CSS and deploy it via GitHub Pages.However, the journey taught me that "simple" doesn't always mean "easy." This README documents not just what I built, but how I grew as a developer while building it.

Javascript, HTML, CSS...

# Future Improvements
This project is a snapshot of my current skills, but I'm already planning updates:
Dark Mode: I want to use CSS variables and JS to add a toggle for dark/light themes.
Download Button: Adding a button to download the PDF version of my resume.
Contact Form: Currently, it's just a mailto link, but I'd love to integrate a real form backend later.

# Acknowledgments
A big thank you to Dr. Tejaswita Mishra for the guidance on this micro-project. This assignment pushed me to stop reading about code and start writing it.
